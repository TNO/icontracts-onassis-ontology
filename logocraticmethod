First, we conducted a deductive representation of timeline as Proactive Data.

E1 = No Payment is a Hazardous Event
E2 = Lack of Deadline is a Cause of No Payment
E3 = Timeline is a Proactive Control of Lack of Deadline
H = Timeline is a Proactive Control of No Payment

Second, we conducted an inductive representation of timeline as Proactive Data.

E1 = No Payment1 is a Hazardous Event1 AND Lack of Deadline1 is a Cause1 of No Payment1
E2 = No Payment2 is a Hazardous Event2 AND Lack of Deadline2 is a Cause2 of No Payment2
...
E1000 = No Payment1000 is a Hazardous Event1000 AND Lack of Deadline1000 is a Cause1 of No Payment1000
H1/E1001 = Lack of Deadline is a Cause of No Payment
E1002 = Timeline is a Proactive Control for Lack of Deadline
H2 = Timeline is a Proactive Control for No Payment

Third, we conducted an abductive representation of timeline as Proactive Data.

E1 = Timeline is a Proactive Control for the Lack of Deadline as Cause of the No Payment Hazardous Event (Q)
E2 = If Timeline is applied as a proactive control the likelihood of the No Payment Hazardous Event reduces (F1), therefore Θ is true.
E3 = When Timeline is applied as a proactive control the likelihood of the No Payment Hazardous Event reduces (Fn), therefore Θ is true.
Therefore
H = When Timeline is applied as a proactive control the likelihood of the No Payment Hazardous Event reduces (Fn)
